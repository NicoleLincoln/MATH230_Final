      "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNCAA Swim Teams with NCAA Records Broken Between 1990 and 2023\r\nIn the data set each row represents a record broken by either an individual or a relay for a team breaks a relay. Everyone in the NCAA has to be represented by a college team, so there are no NA, teams. The size of the boxes in the treemap represents the number of records broken. The larger the box the higher the number of records broken for each team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKey to Understnding : Color → Stroke\r\nColor\r\nStroke\r\nOrange\r\nFreestyle\r\nDark Blue\r\nBackstroke\r\nGreen\r\nBreaststroke\r\nPurple\r\nButterfly\r\nLight Blue\r\nIndividual Medley\r\nRed\r\nFreestyle Relay\r\nYellow\r\nMedley Relay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKey to Understanding : Size → Distance\r\nSize\r\nDistance Description\r\nSmall\r\nShorter distances (e.g., 50 yards is the shortest distance)\r\nLarge\r\nLonger distances (e.g., up to 1650 yards is the longest distance)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Type of Events that Each School Has Broken Records For\r\nFor this word map is similar to the one above, in the sense the you can see the names of each college. Each name of a college represents one record broken for that college. This visualization looks closer at the records in terms of both stroke and distance. The key gives insight as to how to read the tree map to understand which team dominates each event in a unique way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Long Has Each Team Gone Without Breaking An NCAA Record?\r\nThe number of seasons that each team has gone without breaking an NCAA record. Plotting the teams by the maximum number od seasons between records gives the viewer a look into the longest period of time a school has gone without breaking a record based on the date that records were broken for each team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich team has the Highest Proportion of Indiviuals Breaking NCAA Records?\r\nOlympians are a representation of the best swimmers each country has to offer to compete against one another to see who is the best. Many individuals pick their college to complete their colliegate career based on many aspects such as coaching staff, student health staff, and other athlete development aspects. Many international Olympics also come to the United States to compete in the NCAA and develop their craft. The teams with Olympians breaking NCAA records are were sorted out and used to make a pie chart to see the proportion each school’s record-breaking Olympians compared to the total number of Olympians who have broken NCAA records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTeam Work Makes the Dream Work\r\nRelay records were also recorded in this data set, still represented as individual rows. Releys are the top swimmers on each team combined to race with other teams and many give a better picture into the nature of the top of each school’s talent without focusing on individuals. Teams that have broken relay records were reocrds and the frequency ploted to compare schools to one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes Distance Matter?\r\nContinuing to look at relays. Distance could also play a role in deciding which team is the best. Some teams are recruit more distance swimmers and some focus on sprinters. As relays are a better picture of the top of each team’s talent we can see how each tem performs for relays based upon the distance of the relay. The distances from relays are 100,200,400, and 800 being the longest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCalorie Intake is difficult to Predict\r\nThis dataset was named plates. The data set was collected during research, trying to answer the question: Do people eat more food if their meals are served on larger plates? In row in the data set represents one participant in the study. Some of the variables in this data set include the size of the plate provided, quantity of kcal consumed, mass of food consumed. The variables in the visualization are plate size, food likeability, calories consumed and reported level of hunger. This visualizations shows the correlation that individuals had between their reported level of hunger after lunch and the total number of calories consumed during this experiment. The size of the dots represent how much the individual liked the food, with a larger circle being a higher food likeability score. The color of each dat represents the size of the plate: orange ~ small and blue ~large. The data sets shows that there is not a definite correlation between the variables that is why it is tough to predict calorie intake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Relationship Between Pulse and Height\r\nThe dataset used for this visualization is named survey. It is a survey from individuals taking in data (variables) such as the exercise frequency, smoking status, and age of individual. This is a contour plot with a heatmap of the pulse of an individual as well as the height of the individual. Contour plots allow people to look the the joint distribution of two quantitative variables. The middle circle indicates a central area aof high density for individual’s height and pulse. This individuals shows that some of the individuals are concentrated at aorund 70 bpm pulse and a height of around 170 cm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\nExploring Sampling Distribution Dashboard\r\nThe purpose of the dashboard is to explain the concept of sampling distributions of a data set, specifically to an introductory statistics class (MATH 216). Our group wanted to focus on sampling distribution because although we had a good sense of what a sampling distribution is, we all discussed it, and despite this, this was probably the topic that took the most for us to fully solidify as a concept.\r\nThe first interactive explores what a sampling distribution is and compares it to the population distribution. The user can put an infinite number of numbers as a population, and the code takes 10000 samples of size 10, takes the mean of the samples, and shows the sampling distribution. The second page helps the user explore the Central Limit Theorem and Law of Large Numbers, where they manipulate the number of samples and the sample size.\r\nOur desired takeaway message is that the sampling distribution is driven by randomness and chance. A single value has the opportunity to change a sampling distribution all together. It all depends on your samples from the population and the random numbers from the population in that sample.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
