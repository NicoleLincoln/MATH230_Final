I would like to formally thank you to looking at my website. Being a Biology major in college, this project was a little outside of my wheel house. However, this is probably the most amount of dedication and work that I have put into a project in my college career so far. Throughout this semester I have learned to code and create visualizations for data I have actually have grown to enjoy creating. I hope that throughout looking at this website you guys can see how different stories can be portrayed with different visualizations.
  
  I am currently a Biology major and an intended Applied Statistics minor. My dream is to be a pediatrician after college. I enjoy working with kids as I've been working as a swim instructor as my first job. I have found a love for Statistics since my Statistics 1 class in school. I find it very intriguing as to how raw data can be used an interpreted to tell as story. Some of these stories can be useful or hurtful, and looking at data through all angles can be a way to get a full story. I hope to inspire people to look at pieces of the stories to hopefully be interested in learning about the full story. 

I hope you guys enjoy the website:)
